# About me

Hello! I'm WazzaP, a young content creator from Serbia.
I love gaming, tech-related things, PCs and programming.

# Projects
I'm working on modding [Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour](<https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732960/Command__Conquer_Generals_Zero_Hour/>), specifically the [WazzaP's Boss Generals Mod](<https://github.com/ItsWazzaP/wazzaps-boss-generals>).

I'm also *sometimes* working on my [Personal Website](<https://wazzap.org>). Check out the repository [here](<https://github.com/ItsWazzaP/itswazzap.github.io>).

In all the above mentioned projects, I can find my way around quite easily and do pretty much whatever I want by myself.
That isn't true for my next project.

The [Steve Saga](<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5jr0ZJTfioi2Zag3FT6QFhECcceBnNEE>) mod for Minecraft Forge 1.12.2, check out the repository [here](<https://github.com/ItsWazzaP/steve-saga-mod>), is a mod I started creating because I was bored and it was the first thing that came to mind.

The Steve Saga is an old YouTube Minecraft Roleplay series where the main character is in a world with supernatural entities, aka. the Steves.
I used to watch that series a lot when I was just a kid.
It basically had some items that were created using texture packs for better lore and overall storytelling, like Rainbow Stone.
My idea here was to create those blocks and items as blocks and items of their own instead of having to use a texture pack, and have some additional items that people can use for their own Steve Saga stories.

# Achievements
1. Modding C&C Generals Zero Hour - Understanding the fundamentals and advanced INI coding (Not good with animations and W3D).
2. Getting relatively fluent in reading C# - Being able to understand what some code does with relative ease (Still not good with writing C#).

# Goals
## ---Programming---
I wanna get good at programming in C# (as my main language) and C (as my secondary language). I also wish to at least know the basics of C++, Java and whatever I find interesting in my journey.
It would also be funny as heck if I learned HolyC and became fluent in it. Perhaps one day.

I don't have a specific time I wanna achieve all of this in, but I'll be working on it from time to time. C# by myself and C mostly in school.

## ---Content Creation---
I'd love to be able to create fantastic videos with more complex editing at some point.
Then, I'd also love to know semi-advanced 3D modeling and animation, get good at drawing (both on paper and digital), texturing (mostly something for games like Minecraft or whatever project I might come up with throughout my journey) and get deeper into music/beat production.

I'm currently working on improving myself and learning as much as I can.
