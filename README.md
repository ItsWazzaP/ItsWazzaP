# About me

Hello! I'm WazzaP, a young content creator from Serbia.
I love gaming, tech-related things, PCs and programming.

# Projects
I'm working on modding [Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour](<https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732960/Command__Conquer_Generals_Zero_Hour/>), specifically the [WazzaP's Boss Generals Mod](<https://github.com/ItsWazzaP/wazzaps-boss-generals>).

I'm also *sometimes* working on my [Personal Website](<https://wazzap.org>). Check out the repository [here](<https://github.com/ItsWazzaP/itswazzap.github.io>).

In all the above mentioned projects, I can find my way around quite easily and do pretty much whatever I want by myself.
That isn't true for my next project.

The [Steve Saga](<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5jr0ZJTfioi2Zag3FT6QFhECcceBnNEE>) mod for Minecraft Forge 1.12.2, check out the repository [here](<https://github.com/ItsWazzaP/steve-saga-mod>), is a mod I started creating because I was bored and it was the first thing that came to mind.

The Steve Saga is an old YouTube Minecraft Roleplay series where the main character is in a world with supernatural entities, aka. the Steves.
I used to watch that series a lot when I was just a kid.
It basically had some items that were created using texture packs for better lore and overall storytelling, like Rainbow Stone.
My idea here was to create those blocks and items as blocks and items of their own instead of having to use a texture pack, and have some additional items that people can use for their own Steve Saga stories.

# Goals
## ---Programming---
I wanna get good at programming at least one language, preferrably Java or C#, and know the basics of Java, C, C++, C#, Rust and Python.

I don't have a specific time I wanna achieve all of this in, but I'll be working on it from time to time.

## ---Content Creation---
I'd love to be able to create fantastic videos with more complex editing at some point.
Then, I'd also love to know the basics of 3D modeling and animation, digital drawing, texturing and get deeper into music/beat production.

I'm currently working on improving myself and learning as much as I can.
